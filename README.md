## About
This site was born from the basic visual design of my [old landing site](https://github.com/ThatStella7922/old-landing-tng) which was essentially just someone else's site but modified to show my name, socials and background image.

I was running into issues when customizing it, so I challenged myself to get the same look while doing a complete rewrite from scratch. No ready-made frameworks, no code from the old site, just a fresh start. Overall, I think it's come out pretty well.

The site attempts to maintain compatibility with older browsers and operating systems, and as such it doesn't require HTTPS and will load on Android 5-era versions of the Android WebView, iOS 6 MobileSafari, IE9, etc. with "good enough" compatibility. It'll even be functional (albeit not very pretty) on IE**5**.

I appreciate suggestions and new ideas for this website, as it's what most people first see from me. Create GitHub issues as needed, and I'll try to look into things.
