## Development and contribution
Due to the principles above, this site is incredibly easy to work with.

The site uses just HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. No PHP for now, which makes locally serving it way easier than some other sites.

To get started with the site for local modification:
1. Clone repo
3. Start a local web server and visit the page
4. You are now ready to edit

You can use a live refreshing webserver in your IDE like [Five Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yandeu.five-server) in VSCode, to make editing even quicker. Or you can use something as basic as Python's integrated webserver.

Do be aware that this site does reference Font Awesome from my files domain ([files.thatstel.la](https://files.thatstel.la)) on load, so you might want to copy the files locally and change the applicable paths for offline editing.

No building, no npm, no node, no Docker, just a good ol website.
